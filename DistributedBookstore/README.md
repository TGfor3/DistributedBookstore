    Mentor: Yoel Spotts
Pre-requisites: JDK 11, Gradle 7

Set up requirements:
    1) Prior to start up of each server, environment variables (PORT, ADDRESS, HUB) must be set with a domain available to your network.
    2) Run the HubApplication first.
    3) Run a DatastoreApplication and POST a server before running another.
    4) Repeat step 3 without overlapping for as many servers as wanted.

Now you can connect to any server on the network using CRUD commands from any server and use the datastore as if it was a non-distributed web application.

Thank you for checking out our work!
